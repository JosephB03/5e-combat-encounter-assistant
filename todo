# Todo List

- Fix default props for all components
- Implement more robust Sliding through the table
- Implement multiple JSON files
- Preview monsters on addition
    > Would need to implement storage
- Implement About page
- Learn Tailwind CSS


# Debugging
> Not all URLs lead to the appropriate monster
> Encounter is cleared when moving to /encounter, must figure out how to access it in /encounter and
how to ensure it is not cleared

# Misc
> Deal with Alignment jank (has just been removed for now)
> Can maybe edit Monsters.js to remove the Monsters state?
